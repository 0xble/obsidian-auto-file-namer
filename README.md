# Automatic File Namer

Automatically name your files using GPT-3 based on the file's contents.

## Usage

This uses [GPT-3](https://beta.openai.com/). To use it, you'll need to grab an API key from [your dashboard](https://beta.openai.com/), and save it to "OpenAI API Key" setting in this plugin's settings tab. It should look like `sk-XXXXXXXX`.

Once you have configured your API key, run the "Generate name for current file" command to name the current active file.
